Znajdujesz się na aplikacji napisanej w React, będąca swego rodzaju landing page mojej osoby. Nie jest ona jeszcze skończona. Do animacji użyłem animate CSS. W aplikacji znajdują się linki do GH, LinkedIna i Linktree, krótki opis mojej osoby wraz ze zdjęciem oraz CV. Ponadto planuje umieścić na tej stronie moje Projekty, publikacje oraz formularz kontaktowy. Aplikacja jest w rozbudowie.

Kompilacja:

git clone https://github.com/szymonjozwiakzip/landing
cd landing-page
npm start

You are on an application written in React, which is a kind of landing page of my person. It is not yet finished. I used animate CSS for the animation. In the application there are links to GH, LinkedIna and Linktree, a short description of my person with a photo and a resume. In addition, I plan to put my Projects, publications and contact form on this page. The application is under development.

Compilation:

git clone https://github.com/szymonjozwiakzip/landing
cd landing-page
npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
